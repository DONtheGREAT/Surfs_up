### Surfs Up

## __Overview of Project__

The purpose of this analysis is to present to a business partner the data that will determine if a ice cream and surf shop will be an
advantageous venture in Oahu, Hawaii. Specifically relying on a dataset displaying weather in Hawaii of the area of interest. The ideal
climate for the unique product combination would be hot enough to make ice cream enjoyable but not too much rain to deter surfers. The 
temperature and precipitation were filtered down to the metering station nearest to the desired location. From there the areas with the 
most recorded inches of rain and lowest temperatures were avoided and the months with ideal conditions were

- With a high count in temperature readings, the month of June has a higher reliability in accuracy of the data summary. It has a count that 
is almost 200 counts more than December.
- The minimum temperature of December is at a low of 56 degrees which if isn't a deterrent from surfing it may definitely be a deterrent from 
eating ice cream. This data point may favor June more than December but this does not deem the business unsustainable year round.
- Due to not a drastic varying difference in the summaries of these two months, we can conclude that this business can be sustainable 
year round.
